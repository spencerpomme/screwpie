## Project Screwpie


This project is a toy project of web crawler specifically targeted on douban groups since it has no official provision of API.

2.  Crawl **a step deeper**: reveal social networking graph of author and followers.

3.  Connect the crawler with a SQL database instead of current CSV file.

4.  Provide a **CLI** to use this project.

5.  Add multi-threading support.

6.  Add a front-end to visualize data scraped using [D3.js](https://d3js.org) (or other library)
